## Javascript Set List Creator
This project was built for musicians wanting to create setlists quickly and easily that are modifiable and user friendly. You can add, edit, update, and delete any song and any setlist.  You can also drag and drop songs onto setlists/and or remove them.

## Installation && Getting Started
After cloning the project, be sure to run

$ bundle OR bundle install

To include all dependencies

I recommend opening the front end by CDing into setlist-creator-frontend and then running:
open index.html

You can run the server on the backside by opening another terminal and CDing into setlist-creator-backend and running:
rails s


## Development

In your terminal, run the command:

$ bundle exec rails db:setup

To seed the Database with some data, run:

$ rails db:seed

Start up the local server

$ rails s OR rails server

To pull up the interactive console

$ rails c OR rails console

Run Control + C to stop the server at any time.
